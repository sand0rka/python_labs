class Trolleybus(Transport):
    """
    A class representing a trolleybus.

    Attributes:
        id (int): unique identifier of the trolleybus, the default value is 100;
        route_number (int): number of the route on which the trolley runs;
        current_stop (String): the current stop at which the trolleybus is located;
        max_speed (float): the maximum speed of the trolleybus;
        capacity (int): the capacity of the trolleybus (the number of passengers that the trolleybus can carry);
        passengers (int): the current number of passengers carried by the trolleybus.

    Methods:
        stop(self): stops the trolley at the current stop (changes the speed to 0);
        start(self): sets the current speed of the trolleybus to 20 km/h;
        add_passenger(self): adds one passenger to the trolleybus (if there are enough free seats);
        remove_passenger(self): removes one passenger from the trolley (if there is one in the trolley);
        __str__(self): returns a string representation of the Trolleybus object.

    Properties:
        id: unique identifier of the trolleybus, the default value is 100;
        route_number: number of the route on which the trolley runs;
        current_stop: the current stop at which the trolleybus is located;
        max_speed: the maximum speed of the trolleybus;
        capacity: the capacity of the trolleybus (the number of passengers that the trolleybus can carry);
        passengers: the current number of passengers carried by the trolleybus.
